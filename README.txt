Time Spent: 2 hours and 40 minutes 

I wanted to perfect this page as much as I possibly could but it was extremely important that I spent majority of my time building an effective user experience and an aesthetic page that's able to scale dynamically on any device. 

If I had more time to improve this page, I'd test out numerous transitions, animations, a ton more fonts and I would of liked to research commercial-free images. I also would upgrade this program by having it interact with a user such as displaying a welcome back message when they reload the page.
